# Data Structures

This project was made for university purposes.

It implements selected data structures to measure their operational time and space complexity.

The implemented data structures are:
  * Dynamic array
  * Doubly linked list
  * Binary heap
  * Binary search tree
  * Red-black tree

It also conducts time tests to analyze the time complexity of the operations performed on each data structure.

The results are presented in Polish in the report.
